# PHP Badwords

This is a simple project intended to be a first approach to php.

The form will ask for a paragraph and a word to censor.  
On submit it will output the entered paragraph with its length, the word to censor, and a censored paragraph with all instances of the word censored by three asterisks.  
Both the paragraph and the word to censor will be trimmed of any surrounding spaces.
